        <h2 class="border-box" id="why-al">Why Animal Liberation?</h2>
        <p class="medium-box">Individual nonhuman animals, because they are endowed with a brain
           and nervous sytem, have conscious experience, subjective awareness,
           and the capacity to feel pain, love, fear, and many other complex
           emotions. Animals possess<span>sentience</span>, and as such,
           have an interest in their own lives that makes it unethical for
           humans to intentionally use, exploit, or kill them for our needs
           when we don't need to.<br>

           Because we, as individuals, cannot control what body we are born
           into, it is a logical extension of empathy, compassion, and the
           Golden Rule that animals should be allowed to enjoy their lives,
           families, and freedom in peace, just as we would if we were in their
           position.

    <div class="margin-left" id="who-we-are"><h2 class="border-box">Who We Are:</h2>
    <p class="medium-box">We are local Santa Barbara volunteers and activists that believe
      societal progress requires action, outreach, and organizing. We support
      all social justice movements, past and present.<br>
      We are all former meat-eaters who had a change in conscience upon being
      made aware of the truth of animal agriculture, and the horror of what its
      victims experience, and we are driven to bring an end to it within one
      generation.
